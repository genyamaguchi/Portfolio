            Hello! My name is Gen Yamaguchi Butler, but in Japan, I go by 山口玄 (Yamaguchi Gen). <br><br>I am a photographer and am starting to learn code as can be seen through this website. Through my photography, I enjoy capturing a wide variety of styles, from candid street photography, to staged photos where my friends pose for the shots. I also enjoy landscape and scenery photography; I don't have a preference. <br><br>You won't be able to tell from seeing the website alone, but I'm sure that a lot of my code is highly inefficient and redundant. In the future, I hope to learn more about coding and discover my passion. <br><br>This life of discovery can be seen through one of my favorite mottos, "life is about seeing." The ability to acknowledge everything that is going on in life and appreciating it down to its core is what has shaped me today. Being present in the moment, and noticing your surroundings is not only important in photography, but in life. 
    
    I hope you enjoy this website!
